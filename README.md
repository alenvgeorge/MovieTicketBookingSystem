## Description
The purpose of the movie ticket booking system is to provide an alternate way for users to purchase movie tickets. The system offers separate login for users as well as the admin.
A user needs to register by providing his/her details, prior to login. 

After logging in, the functions available for the user are:

*   View List Of Movies
*   Book Ticket
*   View Booked Ticket
*   Search for Movie

The admin username and password and embedded in the code and cannot be changed. The functions available for admin are:

*   Add Movies
*   View All Bookings

The project is done using the concept of structures and file handling. All the details entered by the admin and the users are stored in a file and so the details are not lost when the program is terminated. The system hence provides a reliable method for storing and accessing data.
